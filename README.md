# ejsdemo
Study in, or possibly later, a home for stray snippets for an ExpressJS server talking to a SQLite database.

To-dos:
- a sort of menu in Home
- DB Interface:
    - Table index:
        - get rid of schema
        - move /db/ to /table/ with /table/:name intact
        - add links
    - SELECT args from GET args
